# portfolio-management-tools

A repository of tools for long term investing and/or options trading.

There needs to be a clear distinction between:

* (A) trading with traditional/quantitative finance methods; v.s

* (B) trading with price action and technicals.

I have a separate repository for (B), it's called "pinescript-projects". 

This repository **focuses on (A) traditional/quantitative finance methods**.

Here is a quick summary of materials to be found in this repository:
| File          | Remarks |
| ------------- | ------- |
| **Fundamentals_Scraper_BS_and_PL_(Recent_Quarter).ipynb** | For obtaining financial statement line items in bulks.|
| **MPT_with_Empyrial.ipynb** | For MPT applications; ie. calculating the optimal portfolio allocation. |
| **Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Random_Walk.ipynb**| For forecasting reasonable ranges for price. |

These scripts are considered as pre-processing tools. Python is great, but only to the extent for pre-processing of data. At the end of the day, for the purpose of presenting the results; either to youself or others, it's still better to use Excel where you can easily adjust the colors and layouts on ad-hoc basis by dragging and dropping :D
