# portfolio-management-tools

A collection of tools for long term investing.
By long term investing, I refer to buy & hold, long-only, strategies. 

I have separate repositories for:
| Topic | Remarks | Link |
| ------| ------- | ---- |
|[Options pricing](https://github.com/kevinhhl/options-trading-tools)|Options analysis, modeling techniques, and more. |[Link](https://github.com/kevinhhl/options-trading-tools)|
|[PineScript Projects](https://github.com/kevinhhl/Pinescript-Projects)|A STAT101 approach to technical analysis |[Link](https://github.com/kevinhhl/Pinescript-Projects)|

<br>

Here is a quick summary of materials to be found in this repository:
| File          | Remarks |
| ------------- | ------- |
| **Fundamentals_Scraper_BS_and_PL_(Recent_Quarter).ipynb** | For obtaining financial statement line items in bulks.|
| **MPT_with_Empyrial.ipynb** | For MPT applications; ie. calculating the optimal portfolio allocation. |
| **Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Random_Walk.ipynb**| For forecasting reasonable ranges for price. |

These scripts are considered as pre-processing tools. Python is great, but only to the extent for pre-processing of data. At the end of the day, for the purpose of presenting the results; either to yourself or others, it's still better to use Excel where you can easily adjust the colors and layouts on ad-hoc basis by dragging and dropping.
